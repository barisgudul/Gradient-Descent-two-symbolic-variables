# Gradient Descent for Function Minimization

This Python script aims to find the minimum point of a mathematical function using the gradient descent method.

## Usage

1. Run the `main.py` file in the project's main directory to find the minimum point using the gradient descent method.

   ```bash
   python main.py
Adjust the initial values (x_1_value, x_2_value), learning rate (alpha_value), and the number of iterations (iterations) as desired to observe the results.
